    <ol>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>
            Tip the paste into a large high-sided frying pan with 3 tbsp water and cook for 5 mins. Add 4 tbsp korma paste and cook for a further 2 mins until aromatic. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir 4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces, into the sauce. Add 50g ground almonds, 4 tbsp sultanas, 400ml chicken stock and ¼ tsp golden caster sugar.
        </li>
        <li>
            Give everything a good mix, then cover and simmer for 10 mins or until the chicken is cooked through.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove the pan from the heat, stir in a 150g pot Greek yogurt and some seasoning, then scatter over a small bunch of chopped coriander and more ground almonds, if using. Serve with brown or white basmati rice.
